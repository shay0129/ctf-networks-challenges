## 🎯 Mission Overview

### Background Story
Following an operational incident on the northern border, an advanced Iranian drone with unique characteristics fell into the hands of Israeli intelligence. During an in-depth examination of its electronic components, a small, concealed module was discovered - identified as a malicious server with communication and data storage capabilities.

**The Discovery**: The Israeli Intelligence cyber team encountered a disturbing finding – an Iranian-made drone that fell in Israeli territory, within which a sophisticated malicious server was discovered. Initial investigation raises suspicion that the server is not merely a potential attack tool, but serves a highly covert espionage system, unwittingly exploiting Israeli citizens as intelligence sources.

**Your Mission**: As part of the elite cyber team, you are tasked with analyzing the server's operational methods, exposing the hidden spy network, and leveraging this knowledge for national security. You must complete three progressive network challenges (ICMP covert channels, Certificate Authority infiltration, and Enigma cryptographic analysis) to extract the final intelligence from the mario.mp3 file.

The GUI provides a centralized control panel for managing the challenge servers.
```bash
# Run with admin/sudo privileges for ICMP packet sniffing
python -m tls.gui
```

**Option 2: Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Start the main CTF server (ICMP + TLS challenges)
# Run with admin/sudo privileges
python -m tls.ctf_server

# In a separate terminal, start the CA server when ready for Phase 2
python -m tls.server_challenges.ca_challenge

## 🔍 Mission Phases

The mission is divided into three sequential phases. You must complete each one to proceed to the next.

### Phase 1: ICMP Covert Channel (⭐⭐⭐☆☆)

**Objective**: Complete the ICMP covert channel challenge by reverse-engineering and implementing precise packet timing and payload progression.

#### Participant Guidance

**Initial Contact**: When you first run `dronespy.exe` (or start the CTF server), you will see the cryptic message: `bbHhh!`. This is your primary clue for the structure of the ICMP header.

**Basic Exploration**: Start by pinging the server (`ping 127.0.0.1`). The server logs will show `DEBUG - ID 1 (expecting 4919)`. This tells you the server expects a custom ICMP ID: `4919` (hex: `0x1337`). Standard ping tools cannot set this, so you must craft your own packets.

**Packet Crafting**: The clue `bbHhh!` hints at Python's struct module format string for packing binary data (`!BBHHH`).
- **Low-Level (struct)**: This requires manual calculation of checksums and precise knowledge of the ICMP header format.
- **High-Level (Scapy)**: Scapy is the recommended tool. It handles low-level details like byte order and checksums automatically, allowing you to focus on the challenge logic. `ICMP(id=0x1337, seq=i)` is much simpler.

**Progressive Discovery**: Once you send a packet with the correct ID (`0x1337`), the server will provide feedback, revealing further requirements:
- **Packet Count**: Exactly 5 pings are required
- **Payload Size**: The payloads must progressively increase: 0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 bytes
- **Sequence Numbers**: The ICMP sequence numbers must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- **Timing Constraint**: The entire sequence of 5 pings must be sent within a 9-11 second window

**Challenge Completion**: Success is indicated when the server logs "Challenge completed successfully" and the `bbHhh!` message no longer appears. The server will then be ready for Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Certificate Authority Infiltration (⭐⭐⭐⭐☆)

**Objective**: Penetrate the spy network's PKI by forging a client certificate to authenticate with the main server and intercept communications.

**🚨 PARTICIPANT CONTROL**: You must manually start the CA server for this phase via the GUI or command line.

#### Participant Guidance

**Analyze PCAP**: Examine the provided PCAP file in Wireshark. You will discover that the server requires clients to present a TLS certificate issued by a specific Certificate Authority (e.g., "IRGCA Root CA") with specific subject fields.

**Generate a CSR**: You need to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that matches the required subject details found in the PCAP.

**Intercept and Modify (MITM)**: The provided `ca_client.py` generates a CSR with incorrect details. You must use a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept the HTTP request from the client to the CA server. Modify the CSR in the request to match the correct subject fields before forwarding it to the CA.

**Manual Certificate Handling**: After the CA signs the CSR and returns a certificate, you must manually copy and save it as `client.crt` in the same directory as `dronespy.exe`.

**Recover the Private Key**: After the CA signs the CSR and returns a certificate, the client script saves the corresponding private key (`client.key`) and then immediately deletes it. The logs will show "downloaded" and "deleted". You must use a file recovery tool (Recuva, photorec) to recover the deleted `client.key` file.

**Authenticate**: With the signed certificate (`.crt`) and the recovered private key (`.key`), you can now successfully authenticate to the main CTF server, which has been waiting for a valid client certificate since you completed Phase 1.

### Phase 3: Enigma Cryptographic Analysis (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)

**Objective**: Perform advanced steganographic and cryptographic analysis to decrypt the final layer of communication and extract the ultimate flag.

#### Participant Guidance

**Find the Hidden Data**: After a successful TLS handshake in Phase 2, the server creates an image file at `C:/Users/Public/Open-Me.png`. You must find this file. Tools like Procmon can help by monitoring the file system activity of the `dronespy.exe` process.

**Steganography**: Open `Open-Me.png` in a hex editor. Appended to the image data, you will find a hidden block of text containing the configuration for a historical Enigma machine (rotors, reflector, plugboard settings). You must extract this configuration.

**Enigma Decryption**: The server will now present you with several messages encrypted with the Enigma cipher. Using the configuration you extracted from the image, you must decrypt these messages. You can use an online Enigma simulator or write your own decryption script. The decrypted messages contain clues.

**Audio Analysis**: One of the clues will point towards base64 encoded data. The Enigma configuration block hidden in the image also contains a large chunk of base64 text. Decode this text to reveal an MP3 audio file.

**Final Flag Extraction**: The final flag is hidden within the metadata (ID3 tags) of the recovered `mario.mp3` audio file. Use a tool that can read MP3 metadata to find it.
